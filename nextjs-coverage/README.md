# Jest Next.js Playwright example with coverage

This example shows how to use the [babel-plugin-istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) to determine coverage data during the runtime with your end-to-end tests which will be stored onto the file system.

You are able to view the coverage in your browser with the `npx nyc report --reporter=html` command which is then available in the coverage folder `coverage/index.html`.
